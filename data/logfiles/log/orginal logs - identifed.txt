Comprehensive Error and Warning Report


1. GitLab Runner Initialization & Kubernetes Executor Warnings

Error Message:
"Waiting for pod gitlab-cloud-native/runner-lg9ymnbpv-project-29069-concurrent-1-q66ei5dj to be running, status is Pending"
Location:
Initialization section, just after Kubernetes executor setup.
Cause(s):
Kubernetes executor experiencing delays in reaching Running status, likely due to pending resources or namespace configuration issues.
Solution(s):
Check Kubernetes cluster resources, namespaces, and permissions. For persistent issues, verify Kubernetes pod quotas and any network or DNS issues within the GitLab environment.


2. Warning on SSL Trust Manager Configuration

Warning Message:
"Skipping additional SSL Trust Manager configuration because both $SRCCLR_SSL_CERT_DIR and $SRCCLR_SSL_CERT_FILE are blank"
Location:
During step_script stage (initialization of the scan).
Cause(s):
The environment variables $SRCCLR_SSL_CERT_DIR and $SRCCLR_SSL_CERT_FILE are unset, causing SSL configurations to default.
Solution(s):
Set appropriate SSL cert paths if the environment requires custom SSL certificates. This can prevent issues with connections, especially in secured network environments.
Previous Fixes:
Check commit history for configuration management, especially around SSL/TLS environment settings, which may provide guidance.


3. Fatal Error: Unsupported Build System

Error Message:
"com.sourceclear.agent.FatalException: No supported build system found. Please see our list of supported systems at https://help.veracode.com/go/c_sc_supported_lang."
Location:
In ComponentEngineBuilder.java (Line 926), raised in ScanCommand.java.
Cause(s):
The project uses a build system not supported by the Veracode SCA tool.
Solution(s):
Review the project’s build system compatibility with Veracode’s requirements, and adjust the project’s build system to a supported type if necessary.
Previous Fixes:
Check past commits where the veracode-sca scan has run successfully, as they may contain adjustments to the build system or CI configurations.


4. Artifact Upload on Failure

Message:
"Uploading artifacts for failed job veracode_sca_vulnerabilities.json"
Location:
End of the log during the cleanup phase, upload_artifacts_on_failure.
Cause(s):
Automatic artifact upload upon job failure, ensuring veracode_sca_vulnerabilities.json is saved.
Solution(s):
Review the artifact (veracode_sca_vulnerabilities.json) for additional scan-related errors or configuration details.
Associated Commits:
Check GitLab CI configuration files, specifically .gitlab-ci.yml, for previous changes in artifact upload behavior or retry logic on failed jobs.


5. Job Failure: Exit Code 1
Error Message:
"ERROR: Job failed: command terminated with exit code 1"
Location:
Final line of the log, indicating job termination.
Cause(s):
This exit code is generally raised by the primary error in the build system compatibility issue.
Solution(s):
Resolve the primary error (unsupported build system) as outlined above.
Additional Reference:
Previous GitLab job logs may reveal patterns or similar exit codes for comparison.
Summary
This log file analysis highlights a critical failure in the Veracode SCA scan due to an unsupported build system. Additional environment warnings, such as SSL and Kubernetes initialization, should also be reviewed, but they are not blocking the job execution directly.

Primary Focus: Resolve the unsupported build system error as it directly causes job termination.
Secondary Focus: Review SSL and Kubernetes configurations, which might prevent future issues but are not the main causes of the job failure here.
