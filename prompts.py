## Detailed Task Breakdown

1. **Read and Analyze Entire Log Data:**
   # - Process the complete log data systematically.
   # - Carefully review each log entry and retain any contextual details that might contribute to understanding each error or warning message in-depth.

2. **Identify Error and Warning Messages:**
   # - Find all messages that indicate errors (e.g., entries labeled "Error," "Exception") or warnings (e.g., entries labeled "Warning").
   # - Capture the exact text of each error or warning message for accurate analysis and reporting.

3. **Add a Heading for Each Issue:**
   # - For each identified issue, add a **Heading** field. This field should include the issue type (Error or Warning) and a concise summary of the problem.
   # - For example: "GitLab Runner Initialization & Kubernetes Executor Warnings," "Fatal Error: Unsupported Build System," or "Artifact Upload on Failure".
