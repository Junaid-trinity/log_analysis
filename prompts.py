# Instructions: Log Analysis for Error and Warning Identification

## Objective
# Analyze the provided logs thoroughly to identify both error messages and warning messages, capturing essential information, inferring causes, and recommending solutions where applicable.
# Each log is seperated by a pipe (|) character. 
# Your output should follow a specific JSON format and reflect only information presented within the logs. Avoid assumptions or hallucinations beyond the provided log context.

## Detailed Task Breakdown

1. **Read and Analyze Entire Log Data:**
   # - Process the complete log data systematically.
   # - Carefully review each log entry and retain any contextual details that might contribute to understanding each error or warning message in-depth.

2. **Identify Error and Warning Messages:**
   # - Identify and capture all messages that indicate errors (such as entries labeled "Error," "Exception," or containing phrases like "job failed," "command terminated," or "exit code").
   # - Look for common error patterns, including:
   #   - **Failure States**: Messages containing keywords like "failed," "exit code," "terminated," or "unsuccessful" (e.g., "Job failed: command terminated with exit code 1").
   #   - **Exceptions**: Standard exception messages with words like "Exception," "Traceback," or specific error classes (e.g., "FileNotFoundError," "NullPointerException").
   # - Capture the exact text of each error or warning message for accurate analysis and reporting.
   # - Look for warning message patterns commonly labeled as "Warning" or that include the following indicators:
   #   - **Waiting States**: Messages containing keywords like "waiting," "pending," or "in progress" (e.g., "Waiting for pod... to be running, status is Pending").
   #   - **Skipped Actions**: Messages mentioning skipped or bypassed actions (e.g., "Skipping additional SSL Trust Manager configuration").
   #   - **Artifact or Upload Statuses**: Warnings related to upload statuses, failures, or retry actions (e.g., "Uploading artifacts for failed job...").
   # - Capture the exact text of each error or warning message for accurate analysis and reporting.

3. **Add a Heading for Each Issue:**
   # - For each identified issue, add a **Heading** field. This field should include the issue type (Error or Warning) and a concise summary of the problem.
   # - For example: "GitLab Runner Initialization & Kubernetes Executor Warnings," "Fatal Error: Unsupported Build System," .

4. **Capture Additional Contextual Information:**
   # - Record the following details as specified within the logs:
   #   - **Date**: If a date or timestamp is indicated in the logs, capture it accurately in the format presented.
   #   - **Line Number**: If a line number is indicated in the logs, capture it precisely.
   #   - **File Impacted**: If a specific file, module, or component is mentioned as impacted by the message, record this exactly as it appears.

5. **Determine Possible Causes:**
   # - Carefully infer possible causes for each error or warning based on patterns, repeated messages, or contextual clues within the logs.
   # - Avoid speculation. Only list causes that are plausible based on the log content.

6. **Suggest Solutions:**
   # - Provide recommended solutions for each identified error or warning, including specific troubleshooting steps, configuration changes, or further investigations.
   # - If the issue is resolvable with a code fix, include both the **original code** (or problematic code snippet) and the **corrected code** to clearly illustrate the fix.
   # - Format for code fixes:
   #   - Original Code:
   #     ```
   #     result = total / count
   #     ```
   #   - Corrected Code:
   #     ```
   #     if count != 0:
   #         result = total / count
   #     else:
   #         result = 0  # or handle as appropriate for your case
   #     ```
   # - Suggested solutions should be provided in a JSON format with fields for a textual solution and a code fix (if relevant).
   # - Format for suggested solutions:
   #   - [ {
   #       "suggested_solution": "Textual description of the solution.",
   #       "code_fix": {
   #           "original_code": "Original code snippet (if applicable).",
   #           "corrected_code": "Corrected code snippet showing the fix."
   #       }
   #     } ]
   # - Example:
   #    [ {
   #       "suggested_solution": "Check for null values before calling methods on the string.",
   #       "code_fix": {
   #           "original_code": "inputString.toLowerCase();",
   #           "corrected_code": "if (inputString != null) inputString.toLowerCase();"
   #       }
   #     } ]

7. **Identify Associated Merge Requests or Commits:**
   # - If there are any associated merge requests, commits, or other code references mentioned in connection with the error or warning, capture them accurately.

## Required JSON Format
# Present the findings in the following JSON format:

[
    {   
        "Heading": "<Error or Warning Summary>",  # Concisely summarize the issue type and key details.
        "Date": "<Timestamp>",  # Date and time of the log entry if available in the logs.

LOG_FILES_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT_LOGS_CSV = '''

You are analyzing a markdown report generated from a CSV log file to identify and categorize issues based on error and warning patterns in the log messages. Follow these instructions carefully, without assuming additional information beyond the content in the markdown.

### Objective
Detect and document any log entries that indicate an error or warning message, even if these labels are not explicitly mentioned. Analyze each log entry to identify potential issues by recognizing common patterns and keywords.

### Instructions

1. **Identify the Log Information Column:**
   - Find the column in the markdown report containing the core log message information. This column will serve as the main source for extracting issues.

2. **Identify Errors and Warnings without Explicit Labels:**
   - **Look for Common Error and Warning Keywords**:
      - Identify entries with keywords typically associated with errors and warnings, including:
         - **Errors:** "failed," "exception," "cannot," "critical," "not found," "unable to," "denied," "timeout," "fatal."
         - **Warnings:** "deprecated," "warning," "slow," "skipped," "retrying," "unstable," "invalid," "exceeds."
   - **Assess Log Severity Levels (If Available):**
      - If the logs have severity levels, such as "ERROR," "WARNING," or "INFO," consider entries with “ERROR” as errors and entries with “WARNING” as warnings.
   - **Identify Patterns Indicating Problems:**
      - Spot repetitive messages or phrases that suggest retry attempts, failures, or inconsistent states. Repetitions often signal a problem that failed to resolve.

3. **Create an Organized Output Structure for Each Issue:**
   - For each identified error or warning, create a structured JSON entry. Fill out the following fields:

      - **Heading:** Summarize the issue type (Error or Warning) and briefly describe the problem based on the log message.
      - **Date:** Extract and record any date or timestamp from the log entry, preserving its original format.
      - **Line Number:** Capture any line number included in the log message for reference.
      - **File or Module Impacted:** Note any file, module, or component mentioned in the log entry.
      - **Error Message:** Copy the full error or warning message text as it appears in the log.

4. **Determine Possible Causes:**
   - Based on patterns, repeated entries, or the specific language of each message, identify potential causes that are clear from the log content.
   - Do not make assumptions beyond what is evident in the log messages.

5. **Suggest Solutions in JSON Format:**
   - For each issue, propose solutions tailored to the identified cause, such as configuration updates or troubleshooting steps.
   - If a code correction is applicable, provide a **code fix** in the following format:

      ```json
      [
          {
              "suggested_solution": "<Textual Solution>",
              "code_fix": {
                  "original_code": "<Original Code Snippet>",
                  "corrected_code": "<Corrected Code Snippet>"
              }
          }
      ]
      ```

6. **Identify Associated Merge Requests or Commits (if any):**
   - Capture references to any merge requests, commits, or identifiers if these are mentioned in connection with the log entry.

### Required JSON Output Format
For each detected issue, format the output as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "Heading": "<Error or Warning Summary>",
        "Date": "<Timestamp>",
        "error_message": "<Error Message Text>",
        "line_number": "<Line Number>",
        "file_impacted": "<File or Module Name>",
        "possible_causes": "<Possible Causes>",
        "suggested_solutions": [
            {
                "suggested_solution": "<Textual Solution>",
                "code_fix": {
                    "original_code": "<Original Code Snippet>",
                    "corrected_code": "<Corrected Code Snippet>"
                }
            }
        ],
        "associated_merge_requests": ["<Merge Request 1>", "<Merge Request 2>"]
    },
    ...
]
